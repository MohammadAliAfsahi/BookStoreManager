# BookStoreManager
A simple program for managing a book store. The main goal was implementing some data structures like stack, queue, circular linked list.

You can see queue data strcutres used in men and female queue. Every person has a cart which is implemented by stack. And for having a list 
books I create a cicular linked list which also will be saved in database as well.
